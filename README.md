# earnings-project

The purpose of this project is to use Python visualization skills (ie matpolotlib) to answer questions from a dataset of the earnings of recent college graduates. The questions to be explored include:

    Do students in more popular majors make more money?
    What is the gender divide based on different majors?
    Which category of majors are most popular?
